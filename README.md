# ChrisG-CS-470 Full Stack Cloud Application
For this project, I developed a full stack application that runs on AWS. This project uses an API to talk to a MongoDB database running on AWS. This API allows for the creation, reading, updating, and deleting of user questions and answers on a test front end website. At the moment, anyone can do anything to any post. In addition to this, I also recorded a full presentation on the serverless cloud
